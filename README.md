# SpiderBoi

# About Our Project
Our project aims to create a 2D puzzle platformer game for mobile devices, in which the user tries to navigate a spider by swipe gestures to the finish line by jumping from one obstacle to another and by avoiding hostile environments as well as hostile creatures such as DragonFlyBois. As SpiderBoi moves, it leaves a trail of spider silk behind and when two cords of spider silk intersect, they form a knot. The aim is to complete the level without making more knots than allowed.

The game features a selection of different levels, collectibles called FlyBois that grant different powers when collected, a store from which different skins and backgrounds can be purchased using FlyBois for aesthetic purposes, a variety of different surfaces and hostile creatures called DragonFlyBois.
